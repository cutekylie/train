# Follow this to install
Install the only one dependency: sl

### Follow this for your distro
Arch
```bash
sudo pacman -S sl
```

Ubuntu
```bash
sudo apt install sl
```

For other distro don't worry, I guess the packages is always named as "sl"

Change directory and go into train:
```bash
cd train
```

Then make it:
```bash
sudo make
```

Then install it:
```bash
sudo make install
```

And if you want to remove it, just do:
```bash
sudo make uninstall
```
